     * Core HTTP request implementation using native fetch API.
     *
     * This method handles GET and POST HTTP requests with comprehensive
     * timeout support and error handling. The timeout mechanism works as follows:
     *
     * 1. An AbortController is created for each request
     * 2. If a timeout is specified, setTimeout is used to call abort() after the delay
     * 3. The abort signal is passed to fetch, which will reject the promise if aborted
     * 4. Cleanup occurs in both success and error cases to prevent timer leaks
     *
     * Error handling priority:
     * 1. Timeout errors (AbortError) are converted to "Request timeout" messages
     * 2. Network/connection errors are wrapped with "Network request failed" prefix
     * 3. JSON parsing errors are wrapped with "Failed to parse response" prefix
     *
     * @param url - The target URL for the request
     * @param method - HTTP method (GET or POST)
     * @param options - Optional request configuration (headers, body)
     * @param timeout - Optional timeout in milliseconds for request cancellation
     * @returns Promise resolving to NetworkResponse with parsed JSON body
     * @throws {AuthError} For timeouts or JSON parsing errors
     * @throws {NetworkError} For network failures
